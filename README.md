# LastChipStanding

This is a web application I made for managing poker games with friends. It handles betting rounds, tracks chips, and guides the game flow while you play with physical cards (and pretend you know what you're doing).

## Features

- **Complete Game Flow Management**: So you don't have to remember if the flop comes before the river (it does)
- **Automated Betting Rounds**: Tracks current bets, pot size, and active players
- **Player Management**: Add/remove players and customize starting chip counts
- **Dealer Position Tracking**: Automatically rotates dealer position and posts blinds
- **Real-time Stack Updates**: Watch your chips disappear in real-time! Much fun!
- **Fold Management**: For when your 7-2 offsuit isn't the monster hand you hoped
- **Customizable Blinds**: Set small and big blind values to match your game
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual indicators for the active player, dealer, and game stage
